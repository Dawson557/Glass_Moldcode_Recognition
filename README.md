# Glass_Moldcode_Recognition
Summer 2019 NSERC USRA project.<br><p> Pytorch implemented neural network that recognizes the two digit moldcode imprinted on the bottom 
of glass bottles.</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook <code>Network_Training.ipynb</code> act as the central file for most of the project. View the report that was submitted with the work <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVSP-888HSKSlZJJ0qQHxiSSdyhNll-wLGWlapSymoI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p><i>For non-disclosure reasons (as well as reasonable git upload size) I was unable to attach any of the dataset. Although a few images
are shown in the report and the methodology for my dataset annotation is found there as well.</i>
